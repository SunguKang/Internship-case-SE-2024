## Assignment Overview

**Problem Domain:** E-commerce sales analytics & interactive dashboard application

**Submission Deadline:** 6th August 2024 at 12:00 PM

## Submission Instructions

Please submit your work by sharing your interactive dashboard application URL or HTML file, along with the GitHub repository where your code is hosted. Make sure to add the following users to your repository: @maximilianmaukner, @Sungukang, @RandomAnass. 

## Context

In the rapidly evolving e-commerce industry, online platforms have become pivotal in driving sales and customer engagement. For this case study, you will analyze and work on e-commerce sales data.

## Objectives

Your task is to analyze the datasets provided and extract actionable insights that can help the company optimize its sales strategy and maximize sales by creating interactive dashboard.

### Task 1: Interactive Dashboard Application

Create an interactive dashboard application that visualizes the data and extracts insights from the provided datasets. Your dashboard should provide a comprehensive overview (e.g., sales, products, customers, and country-wise data). It should be user-friendly and include filters (e.g., date, country, product type, customer type). The final result could be used by managers or other team members to gain useful insights from the data.

### Task 2: Cloud Deployment Architecture (Prensentation)

Imagine you are working for a large company with many users and large amounts of data as a software engineer. Conceptualize how you would deploy the dashboard created in Task 1 on the cloud. There is no restriction on using any specific cloud platform (e.g., AWS, Azure, Google Cloud). Present a conceptual architecture design for setting up and deploying the dashboard. Highlight your creative approach and elaborate on the steps involved in the deployment process. You are not expected to deploy the real case, but explain how you would do it in a conceptual way.

#### Consideration Task 2: what potential difficulties might you encounter when deploying the dashoboard on the cloud, and how would you tackle them?

Prepare a 20-25 minutes presentation of Task 1 and ~ 5 minutes for Task 2

### Considerations
- There is no single "correct" solution; we are looking for your unique analytical approach.
- Your ability to derive business insights from the analysis is crucial.
